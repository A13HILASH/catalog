1. Create a Free Cloudinary Account:------------------------------------
Go to the Cloudinary website: https://cloudinary.com/

Click the "Sign Up" button, usually in the top right corner.

You can sign up using a Google or GitHub account, or with your email address. Follow the prompts to create your account.

After signing up, you will be directed to your account's main dashboard.

2. Locate Your API Credentials:-----------------------------------------
Your API credentials are all displayed prominently on the main dashboard of your account. These are the keys your backend server will need to authenticate and interact with Cloudinary.


Once you're on the dashboard, look for the section titled "Account Details" or similar.

You will find the three key pieces of information you need:

Cloud Name: This is a unique name for your cloud environment (e.g., d_example_cloud).

API Key: A public identifier for your account.

API Secret: A private, secure key. This must be kept confidential and should only be used on your backend server. Never expose it in your frontend code.



3. Store Your API Keys:-------------------------------------------------

To use these keys securely in your backend, you should store them as environment variables rather than hard-coding them directly into your source code. This is a best practice that prevents them from being accidentally committed to a public repository like Git
